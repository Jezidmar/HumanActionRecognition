# Human Action Recognition

This repo aims to replicate following methodology:
![Methodology](methodology.png)
Here, I bring non official implementation of algorithm based on paper [Skeleton based HAR](inventions-04-00009-v2.pdf)
. Coding is done in MATLAB and the comments are mostly on Croatian language. Along the code implementation, I added [HAR](HAR.pdf) file where I described the mathISH background of used methods, although it is as well on Croatian language.

Summary:
        Here, we describe Multimodal approach for Human action recognition using tensor decomposition and ANN. Furthermore, the comparison with Random Forests approach is included as well
